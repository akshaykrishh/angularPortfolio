          Text detection in scenes based on deep neural networks have shown promising results.
          Instead of using word bounding box regression, recent state-of-the-art methods have started focusing on character bounding box and pixel-level prediction.
          This necessitates the need...

          Recent work in speech separation works good in constrained environments but still perform poorely in noisy backgrounds.
          To further improve voice separation in noisy environments we propose using transfer learning from Automatic Speech Recognition Models.
